# Text Analysis: Freud's "Dream Psychology"

This project presents a text analysis of Sigmund Freud's "Dream Psychology" using techniques inspired by the "Silent Disco: Introduction to Text Analysis" course at the University of Edinburgh.

## Project Overview
This analysis explores Freud's seminal work on dream interpretation, focusing on key concepts and themes using Python, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), and Matplotlib.

## Key Features
- Cleaning the text: using .lower() to lower the text and RegEx for punctuation.
- Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words.
- StopWords: removing certain words from the corpus.
- Frequency Analysis: Identifying the book's most common words and phrases.
- Frequency Distribution Plot: visual representation of the word's frequencies
- Part-of-Speech Tagging: identifying grammatical parts of speech using nltk.pos_tag, analyzing noun, verb, and adjective distributions to understand the linguistic structure of Freud's text
